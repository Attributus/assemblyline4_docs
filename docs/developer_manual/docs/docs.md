# Updating documentation

This documentation is built using the awesome project: [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

The documentation can be cloned from the following two repositories:
```
git clone git@github.com:CybercentreCanada/assemblyline4_docs.git
git clone git@github.com:CybercentreCanada/assemblyline4_docs_fr.git
```

You can render this documentation locally by installing it:
```
pip install mkdocs-material
```

You can then serve the current working directory with:
```
cd assemblyline4_docs
mkdocs serve
```

Thanks for helping with our docs!
