# Service manifest overview
Every service must have a `service_manifest.yml` file in its root directory. The manifest file presents essential
information about the service to the Assemblyline core system, information the Assemblyline core system must have before
it can run the service. 

The table below shows all the elements that the manifest file can contain, including a brief description of each.

| Field name | Value type | Required? | Description |

| default_result_classification | Classification string | No <br> Default: `Classification.UNRESTRICTED` | The default classification for the results generated by the service. If no classification is provided for a result section, this default classification is used. |
| dependencies | Mapping of [Dependency Config](#dependency-config) | No | Refer to [dependency config](#dependency-config) section. |
| description | Text | No <br> Default: `NA` | Detailed description of the service and its features. |
